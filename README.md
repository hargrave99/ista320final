This data was scraped from ufcstats.com
I scraped the fighter statistics portion of the data using the UFC-Data-Scraper Python package, https://pypi.org/project/UFC-Data-Scraper/.
I scraped data for each event using an R script from https://github.com/jasonchanhku/web_scraping/blob/master/MMA%20Project/MMA%20events%20database.R.
I then cleaned this data in a Google Colab notebook, to get our final clean ufc_data csv file.
